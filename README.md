# Bellybutton Bacteria

## Overview of the Project
Create a dashboard to display bacterial data for a volunteer selected from a drop-down menu. Each selection must display:
1. Demographic info
2. Bar chart with top ten bacterial species in sample
3. Bubble chart to visualize frequency of bacteria found in sample

Optional display: Gauge showing the frequency that the bellybutton is scrubbed weekly.

Dashboard is deployed to GitHub Pages for access to data on any computer.
